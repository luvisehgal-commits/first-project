India's freedom fighters were courageous individuals like Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, and Subhas Chandra Bose,
who dedicated their lives to ending British colonial rule through diverse methods, from Gandhi's nonviolent civil 
disobedience (Satyagraha) and Bose's militant Indian National Army (INA) to the revolutionary actions and sacrifices
of figures like Bhagat Singh, uniting millions in a shared vision for a sovereign nation.
Their combined efforts, spanning peaceful protests, armed resistance, and political leadership, forged modern India, 
leaving a legacy of patriotism and inspiring future generations.
